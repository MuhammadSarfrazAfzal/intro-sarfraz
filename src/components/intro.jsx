        <h1>Hello, I'm Muhammad Sarfraz Afzal</h1>
        <p>
          I am 21 years old and currently working on improving my skills as a 
          React.js developer. I’ve learned frontend development in React.js, 
          and I’m actively looking for a job in this field. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I'm working on a project called <strong>Travel Advisor</strong>, 
          which helps users plan their travels effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside my technical growth, I’m also focusing on enhancing my English 
          speaking skills to communicate fluently in job interviews and everyday conversations. 
          I practice speaking English daily at 8 p.m. to get more comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m also following a weight gain diet plan to reach my health goals.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my page!</p>
